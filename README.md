# Challenge 12 - JavaScript

For this challenge, you will have to solve three tasks.

1. Create an object with the help of a constructor in which will be stored
basic employee data:
- Name
- Company name
- Job position (job position can be: employee, director or boss).
- Salary.
Instance 3 new objects, enter the data for each employee, then print a list
(ul) with all the details of each employee (in HTML).

2. Make a new object - cube with the help of a constructor. In it write
methods for calculating area and perimeter.
- Enter the size of the sides of the cube with the help of a prompt.
Call on this object the appropriate methods for calculating the
area and perimeter, which will print the results in a console.

3. Write a class using a constructor, which will describe an email
message. A method for displaying the entire message on the screen
should be implemented in it (via alert).
Each message has From, To, Subject and Message.
Then instantiate an object based on the previous one, in which these
parameters will be entered through prompts.
Design a page, with fields for email .With the help of the object, display
all the information from the object in the appropriate fields in the form
for sending an email.
