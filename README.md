# Challenge 08 - Bootstrap Mini Project

For this challenge, you will have to make five fully responsive pages using
bootstrap. Refer to the screenshots folder to see the exact look of the
page.
The navbar (active link) has a border on the left when you are on the
specified page. Also, clicking on the logo text goes back to the
homepage.
The Homepage slider has modified indicators and the shadow of the
arrow is gone. Clicking on the play icon above “See What We Do”, opens
a modal with a video in it. After that, there is a gallery where you can
open every image in its full size in a modal by clicking on it.
On the About page, the circled image has to be in the given position. 
On this page also, above the footer, there is a
slider only with text, which doesn’t have indicators, only arrows.
On the Services page, the first banner above is not a slider. After that,
three panels are displaying information about the services provided.
And after them, some panels fold and are not an accordion, which
means you can have as many of them as you want.
On the Blog page, there are three posts, with images and content below
them.
The hamburger icon on the menu must work, but only from mobile
devices.
The homepage slider text disappears on mobile devices.
Use only 1 css file for every page.
