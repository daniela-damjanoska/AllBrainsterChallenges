# Challenge-17 Bike-store-React

For this Challenge the logic & the design should be exactly the same as it was in Challenge 16.

The design should be made with components, meaning you will have at least
4 components:
- Header - containing the whole navbar & the Bikes section below it.
- Card - for the bikes card.
- Filters - for all the filters.
- Footer - containing the footer area.
