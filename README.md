# Challenge 01 - HTML

For this challenge youâ€™ll need to create a whole web page for Apple
devices, with implemented CSS styles. Refer to the screenshots folder to see the
exact look of the page.
Necessary functionality that you should include is that the navbar items should scroll
the page to the section they are meant to. Ex. if you click on iPhone, the page is
scrolled to the iPhone devices section.
While hovering the navbar items, each item changes its color.
The icons for social media items should be done using
font-awesome icons and should redirect the user to a valid page that opens in a new tab.
