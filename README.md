# Challenge 13 = JavaScript

For this challenge, you'll need to work with objects for describing a
book.
- Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has
properties for the title (a string), author (a string), maxPages (int -the number
of pages the book has ), and onPage (int - a number that represents the page
that we are on).
- Iterate through the array of books. For each book, make a list with the book
title and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien ".
- Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether
you read it yet or not (check if maxPages is equal to onPage). If you read it, list
it in the format ‘ You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien’- in green
text , and if not, ‘ You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R.
Tolkien . ‘ -in red text.'
- Make a table and populate it with info about the books. Next to every book,
there should be a progress bar. Calculate the percentage of how far away you
are in the book and show it through the progress bar.
- Under the table, make a form to add a new object (or add the values to the
object through multiple prompts). After clicking submit, the object should be
automatically added to the table together with the progress bar.
