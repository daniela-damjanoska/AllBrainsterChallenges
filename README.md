# Challenge 11 - JavaScript

For this challenge you need to make a keyboard on click.
In HTML, there should be one div with h1 'TI ISPISA:' and a blank p element
below it (in which you will need to add letters per click).Under them, how do
you want to make the keyboard (with buttons/divs - is your choice).
In JS, you need to select all the buttons/divs at once (paste the same class to
make your job easier), iterate through them with forEach, and add an event
listener on click to all of them at once.
When the appropriate letter is clicked, it should be typed in the blank p element.
