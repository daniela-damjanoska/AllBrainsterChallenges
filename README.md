# Challenge 16 - AJAX and JQuery Bike App

For this challenge we are going to make a website store for bikes. 

All the data for every bike is
accessible via this link: https://json-project3.herokuapp.com/products.

The web design should be the same as it is shown in the video. You can see all
of the effects (on hover) and colors in the video. The cards for every bike
should be created dynamically with JavaScript, looping through the array of
objects. The sidebar on the left, the menu & the footer can be created in
HTML.

On the left side, there is a sidebar containing filters. When you first come to the website, the first filter
named 'Show all' should be clicked, which is showing all of the cards on the
page. On click on 'female' for example, you should filter the array, and only
cards which have 'gender' as 'female' should show up on the screen. On click
on 'male' apply the same logic. When you click on some of the filters in the
'Brand' section, you should filter the array and show the cards which have the
corresponding 'brand'.

When you click on each filter, the name of the filter should become
bolder and colored orange.

Also the badges should be filled with the correct numbers to show the customer
how many items are in the selected filter.
