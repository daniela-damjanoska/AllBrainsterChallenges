# Challenge 06 - Git and Flex

In this Challenge youâ€™ll need to create a gallery website full of
images, using Flex. Refer to the screenshots & video folders to see the exact
look of the page.
The menu on the left should be fixed. And every image is a link.
When the page is open in responsive mode (mobile and tablet) the sidebar
menu should be switched to a hamburger menu.
