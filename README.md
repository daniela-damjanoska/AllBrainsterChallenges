# Challenge 04 - Flex

In this Challenge the page should be responsive for mobile devices and when 
the page is open in responsive mode, the navbar menu should be
switched to a hamburger menu that doesnâ€™t need to be functional for now.
Some of the items in the navbar should contain a dropdown menu when you
hover over them. The mouse pointer here should be changed to a hand.
While hovering over the cards in the "Choose your demo" section, you should
add a border around the card.
