# Challenge 07 - Bootstrap

For this challenge, youâ€™ll need to create a fully responsive page using
bootstrap.
The navbar is fixed to the top and must open the navbar links when clicked
on the hamburger menu, on mobile.
There is a plus functionality that you will have as a challenge to make, and
that is the scrollspy.
